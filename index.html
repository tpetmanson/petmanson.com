    <h2 class="title">Artist life simulator released</h2>
    <div class="date">2022-12-18</div>
    <img class="featured-image" src="img/news/artistlifesimulator.jpg"/>
    
    <p>For the past year I've been working on an awesome computer game 
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643180/Artist_Life_Simulator/">Artist Life Simulator</a>
      by <a href="https://www.interactivefate.com">Interactive Fate</a> which saw the official release today on Steam.

    <p>I created more than one hundred candidate songs and soundbites for the game, which needless to say, was quite a challenge :D
      Nevertheless, going out of my usual comfort zone proved to be an extremly entertaining and valuable learning experience for me.
      Otherwise I would have never probably explored the genres and sounds I did when composing music for this title.
      Starting from rag-time and ending up with psytrance, the compositions touched quite a range of genres.
      Interetingly, the most valuable lessons was something else, which I will discuss below.
    </p>

    <p>Perhaps it is interesting to start by sharing how working on such huge project feels and looks like.
      In the past, I've done soundtracks for video clips where I usually request a set of adjectives that would describe the mood of the video.
      This is followed by a back-and-forth of updates and feedback until the complete track is produced.
    </p>

    <p>However, with a project like Artist Life Simulator game, much more content is needed.
      When we had our first talk with Edvin, the head of Interactive Fate, we really were not sure what is needed, except that the music
      should fit into the era where the game was taking place --- early 21st century.
      Of course, I'm not a classical composer, but I have some tricks up my sleeve to make this work.
      Beside that, the game takes place in an alternative universe in a city called Nova Oportunia, 
      so some deviations in style would be completely acceptable and perhaps even intersting.
    </p>

    <p>The game also has a unique aspect of condition and feeling cards that you acquire during gameplay.
      The cards can describe emotions such as love, sadness, passion, frustration. 
      They can describe situations like madness, povertry and so on.
      For a composer, this is a great set of guidelines how a particular track should sound like.
      Of course, this is not as easy as one might think. For instance, how does "humility" sound like? Or what about "admiration of nature"?
    </p>

    <p>The approach that really worked for me was not to over-think it and goign with whatever popped into my mind.
      The approach of composing varied vastly from piece to piece. Sometimes I spent more than a week to finish a song, sometimes I
      made five songs in a day.
      Needless to say, not all songs yielded this way were not great and many needed to be scrapped.
      But this experience tought me to create songs and do it all over and over again, even when I had zero inspiration.
      This is the most valuable lesson I learned and fur sure helped to grow as a composer.
      I usually only finish a small percentage of songs I start. My hard disk is full
      of unfinished projects.
    </p>

    <p>I felt I was pushed to my limits quite often as I often felt I was repeating myself.
      But the time-pressure made me go on.
      I did not had much time to work on the project either as I had my daily job, I started doing renovations at my apartment,
      I was working hard with Mandarones as Summer of 2022 was full of concerts! 
      Yay to our 10th year anniversary (more about that in another post).
    </p>

    <p>However, after playing the launched game, I was very satisfied with the result.
      Huge kudos to Taavi Viikman for final mixing and editing that had a massive impact on the final result to blend the tracks into game
      as they did.
    </p>

    <p>So there you have it! If you want to hear more, go ahead and get the game 
      from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643180/Artist_Life_Simulator/">Steam</a> and enjoy!

    <h2 class="title">Back to the roots!!</h2>
    <div class="date">2021-11-22</div>
    <img class="featured-image" src="img/news/mandarones_tambet.jpg"/>

    <p>It has been a while since my last update here and there are plenty of news to share :D.
    After almost three fabulous years in lovely Switzerland, I decided to get back to the roots and return to Estonia this summer.
    So far, I've been loving it, I took a full six months of vacation and have been relaxing and chilling most of the time.
    </p>

    <p>That said, there has been plenty I've been up to. 
      I performed "Voyage to Neptune" set at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/t%C3%BCri-konn-t%C3%BCri-kogukonnaselts/rohevest-2021/304148690999977/" target="_blank">Türi rohefest</a>,
      wrote some music for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643180/Artist_Life_Simulator/">Artist Life Simulator</a>
      and also met up with my old <i>amigos</i> from <a href="https://mandarones.com/">Mandarones</a> compost rock collective.
      We released EP "Catharsis" with songs recorded back in a day and have been collaborating with performance artists from TEMA movement.
      Our last gig at Tartu Light Festival even had fire-show and acrobats on a tight-rope.
    </p>

    <p>I was hoping to release also one solo album this year.
      There is about three albums worth of material, some finished, some not, but none of it really fits well together. 
      Maybe I should just lower my standards, but I want to put together something that sounds great, is unique and tells a story.
      That said, I don't feel a bit dissappointed if I can't make it this year.

    <div class="date">2020-11-22</div>
    
    <p>The autumn leaves are falling again, marking the end of yet another year.
    The world is painted in fabulous yellow, orange and red tones and cool wind gently breezes and roams
    around the city.</p>
    
    <p>A perfect time to make another song, this time with Benjamin Börchinger. We made an ultra-groovy
    and ultra smooth lo-fi jazz song called "Trumimasen", which is a mix between Estonian "trummimasin" and
    Japanese "sumimasen".
    
    <p>Hope you like the smooth vibes :) Enjoy!</p>

    <p>Tere, internetirändur! Hello, internet traveller!</p>
    <p>I am happy to present you the final version of "Helisupp", an electro-ambient
    psychedelic drummachine, keyboard+looper jam recorded in March 2020.</p>

    </p>
    
    <p>Recording this album made me realize that this is the sound and direction I would like to keep exploring
      a little bit more. First, it is fun to play songs that are this long. Every take comes out completely
      different. Secondly, the way the sounds keep blending into each other is pretty cool.

    <div class="date">2020-07-19</div>
    <img class="featured-image" src="img/news/mountpilatus/timogif.gif"/>
    
    <p>Almost everyone agrees that the best way to take some time off and relax in Switzerland is
      going hiking in the mountains. It is the favourite activity of everyone I know here, including
      myself. There are hundreds of mountains in Swiss Alps, not to mention countless smaller hills,
      connected by passages, mountain rives and walking trails.</p>
    
    <p>This time we decided to go conquer 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilatus_(mountain)">Mount Pilatus</a>, which is situated
      next to Lucerne. We took a train to Alpnachstadt, which has two trails leading to the top and
      is also connected by a cable car, which would be convenient getting back down.</p>
    
    <div id="mountpilatus-gallery"></div>

      lightGallery(document.getElementById('mountpilatus-gallery')); 
    </script>
    
    <p>Nevertheless, that was no easy walk in the park. The length of the track totalling 7km, starting
      at 500m above sealevel, raising over 1,5km in altitude and ending on at top at 2,126m above sealevel.
      It took us over 5 hours to get there and we were really lucky, because if we had come half an hour later,
      we would have missed the last cable car going down. For some reason, the later ones were cancelled.

    <div class="date">2019-12-11</div>
    <p>I guess I do really love night-time, because music sounds so much smoother and better. 
      So, here is a song dedicated to the inspiring darkness.</p>

    <p>Actually, it took a while to get this song right, until I waited till 12AM to start playing. 
      Even then, it took a few days to complete it.</p>
    <p>To be honest, I snatched some chords from an old song I haven’t played in years and 
      I don’t even think I have a recording of that.</p>
    <p>Chords for reference:</p>
    <p>Intro: Ebm / bass does notes</p>
    <p>A: Ebm Gb Ebm Gb <br/>B Db Eb x2
B: Ebm B7 Bb7</p>

      Even in the future<br/>
      we need someone<br/>
      to catch the bad guys ..<br/>
      Officer Raggaman<br/>
      bringing peace to the world<br/>
      that has changed<br/>
      beyond recognition<br/>
      forever
    </p>
    <p>Here is the live looper version of one of my previous tracks: “Officer Raggaman”.</p>
    <p>Officer Raggaman is a hero supercop fighting crime in future in our messed up world. 
      Ze has the strength of a man and wits of a woman, combining this into a powerful 
      crime-fighting machine. 
      Ze knows that reggae is about peace and so is law-enforcement, 
      which ze is a perfect manifestation of.
    </p>
    <p>The original song in my opinion had this kind of 80s police movie feel to it with some 
      siren-like sounds. I tried to replicate that to a certain extent in this version as well.</p>
    <p>I like also the overdriven synth sound that kind of reminds a guitar, but has some really alien feel to it.</p>

    <div class="date">2019-11-02</div>
    <p>It is getting colder and one can feel the how air is getting heavier. 
      The darkness is creeping into the daylight more and more.</p>
    <p>Also, haven’t made a song for a while now, so it is time to keep it up! 
      In fact, I wanted to make something, but had no idea where to start, 
      so I asked N33me for some inspiration. 
      The suggestion was to go for a sad and romantic vibe, so here you go.</p>
    <p>Greetings to Liisi, K-Real and other romanticists out there!</p>

    <h2 class="title">Daydreaming music video</h2>
    <div class="date">2019-09-28</div>
    
    <p>I am proud to present you the music video of “Daydreaming” made by my good friends 
      Dominika Olszewska and Tomek Zakrzewski. Special thanks go to Mirka Jackova, 
      Marta Bajena and Joanna Wawruch.</p>
    
    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IM26cpZJB1c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    
    <p>I think that the video captures the essence of the song perfectly. 
      Wandering around in the city of endless possibilities and experiencing it all. 
      The time and space seem to fade away and become non-existent, 
      while one thing remains the same: the daydream we live in.</p>
    
    <p>The inspiration for the song actually comes a few months back, when I went to 
      Lucerne with Liisi to check out the Fumetto comic festival and just hang out 
      in the city and its numerous museums. 
      When I got home, my eyes were fuzzy, my legs were sore and I must have been still 
      tripping on crazy artwork I experienced throughout the day. 
      That’s when I came up with the song.</p>
    
    <p>I find it amazing how Domi and Tomek have taken the sound of the song and used it to 
      create a visual experience on a completely another level. 
      When I watch the video, I feel exactly the same way as on the day spent in Lucerne. 
      I could not be happier to re-experience this again! Thanks a ton, guys!!</p>
    
    <p>Make sure to check out the video from Domi’s 
      [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM26cpZJB1c" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>]

    <p>Today we went to Lucerne with Liisi to check out the Fumetto comic festival and just hang 
      out in the city and its numerous museums. 
      It was a really awesome day — walking by the Reuss river, chilling in the sunshine, 
      drinking coffee and watching tons of exhibitions from guillotines to really 
      trippy psychedelic pop art.</p>
    
    <img class="featured-image" src="img/news/lucerne.jpg"/>
    
    <p>When I got home, my eyes were fuzzy, my legs were sore and I must have been still 
      tripping on Keiichi Tanaami’s crazy artwork. 
      So I say down and came up with this song — I think it captures the feelings and emotions 
      I experienced throughout the day quite accurately</p>

    <h2 class="title">Zürich</h2>
    <div class="date">2018-12-28</div>
    
    <p>Hello, internet! It will be soon a month since moving all my operations to Zürich! 
      Most of the organizational stuff is done and I am slowly starting to settle in. 
      I can’t wait until I can go to check out some of the mountains around the area to gather 
      some inspiration for working on a new set and album next year.</p>
    
    <p>After packing my stuff in Estonia, I had to leave most of my gear behind as my 
      old Ford Focus would not probably have handled all the load. 
      Thanks to Funderbeam and Kirill for the Code25 MIDI keyboard that is on one of 
      the pictures, which I was able to squeeze in! It plays ball very nicely with Novation Circuit 
      and is very well programmable. 
      Still, it got me really confused at first why standard MIDI out was turned off by default. 
      NB! Press “edit” and “first octave B” to activate MIDI out on M-Audio Code25, 
      just in case you just landed on this page by Googling for solutions.</p>
